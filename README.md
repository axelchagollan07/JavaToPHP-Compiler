# JavaToPHP-Compiler
This project provides a Java-to-PHP source code translator built using Java, JFlex (1.6.1), and Java CUP (11a). The tool aims to facilitate the conversion of Java code into PHP by parsing and transforming Java syntax into equivalent PHP constructs, making it easier to port Java-based applications to PHP-based environments.
